# Tab Saving Chrome Extension
You can save as many tabs into as many sessions as need. Just click the 'Save tabs' button, name your session and you are good to go. If you do not specify a name for the session you are trying to save, a timestamp of that moment will be added as the title of the session.

To restore previously saved tabs, click on the 'Restore' button to restore the full session. You can also restore a single link by expanding the session and clicking on the link you wish to restore.

No tracking, no data is sent across the internet. Everything is saved locally on your device.

You can audit the code participate in the development of the extension in its repository:
